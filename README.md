# React Weather App

##Introduction

This project is a lightweight front-end application that allows the user to track weather for up to 6 cities simultaneously while information updates on a chosen interval.

##Setup

Running this app should be a relatively painless process.
Before you begin, make sure that gulp and gulp-cli are installed on your system, as we'll be using them later.

Next up, you'll want to clone this repo from Github:

```Bash
$ git clone https://github.com/patrickdmccarthy/weather.git
```

Next, navigate to the weather directory, and install node modules:

```Bash
$ npm install
```
or if you run into errors:
```Bash
$ sudo npm install
```

Once all node modules have been installed, you can run the application with:

```Bash
$ gulp serve
```

And then access the application by going to http://localhost:9000/ in your browser.  Enjoy!
